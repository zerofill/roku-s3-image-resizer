# S3 Image Processor

A Node.js application that downloads images from an S3 bucket, processes them into multiple sizes, and reuploads them with public ACL and organized naming.

## Features

- 🔍 **Automatic Discovery**: Lists all images in the specified S3 bucket or folder
- 📁 **Folder Support**: Process images from specific folders like `path/to/images`
- 📥 **Download**: Downloads images to temporary local storage
- 🖼️ **Image Processing**: Creates multiple sizes using Sharp
- 📤 **Reupload**: Uploads processed images with public ACL
- 🏷️ **Organized Naming**: Uses consistent naming convention with size prefixes
- 📊 **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress indicators and status updates
- 🧹 **Cleanup**: Automatically cleans up temporary files

## Image Sizes Generated

For each original image, the app creates 4 versions:

1. **Original Size**: `filename-default.ext`
2. **SD (320x180)**: `filename-sd_320x180.ext`
3. **HD (1280x720)**: `filename-hd_1280x720.ext`
4. **FHD (1920x1080)**: `filename-fhd_1920x1080.ext`

## Supported Image Formats

- JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)
- PNG (.png)
- GIF (.gif)
- BMP (.bmp)
- WebP (.webp)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ installed
- AWS credentials configured
- S3 bucket with appropriate permissions

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## AWS Setup

### Option 1: Environment Variables
Set the following environment variables:
```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1  # Optional, defaults to us-east-1
```

### Option 2: AWS CLI Configuration
Configure AWS CLI:
```bash
aws configure
```

### Option 3: IAM Roles
If running on EC2 or other AWS services, use IAM roles.

## Required S3 Permissions

Your AWS credentials need the following S3 permissions:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:PutObjectAcl"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
                "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Usage

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Enter your S3 bucket name when prompted
3. Enter the folder path (e.g., `path/to/images`) or leave empty for root folder

3. The app will:
   - List all images in the bucket
   - Download each image
   - Process into multiple sizes
   - Upload processed images with public ACL
   - Display the public URLs for each processed image

## Error Handling

The application includes comprehensive error handling:
- Invalid bucket names
- Missing AWS credentials
- Network connectivity issues
- Image processing errors
- Upload failures

Failed operations are logged but don't stop the entire process.

## Performance Notes

- Images are processed sequentially to avoid memory issues
- Temporary files are automatically cleaned up
- Progress indicators show real-time status
- Large images may take longer to process

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **AWS Credentials Error**
   - Ensure AWS credentials are properly configured
   - Check environment variables or AWS CLI configuration

2. **Permission Denied**
   - Verify S3 bucket permissions
   - Ensure bucket allows public read access for uploaded objects

3. **Image Processing Failures**
   - Check if images are corrupted
   - Verify supported image formats

4. **Memory Issues**
   - For very large images, consider processing in smaller batches
   - Ensure sufficient system memory
